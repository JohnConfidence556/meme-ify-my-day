## 🚀 The Vibe
We all have terrible schedules. Instead of trying to "optimize" them with boring productivity tools, **Meme-ify My Day** uses multimodal AI to look at your calendar, messy desktop, or code, and **ruthlessly roast you.**

It doesn't just judge you—it **vibes** with you.

## ✨ Features (The Chaos)
* **👁️ AI Vision (Llama 4 Scout):** Uses Groq's latest multimodal models to "see" your screenshots and identify your deepest insecurities.
* **🔥 The Burnout Meter:** Calculates a scientific "Trauma Level" based on your meeting density.
* **🗣️ Voice of Judgment:** Uses browser Speech Synthesis to read your roast out loud.
* **🔊 Sound Effects:** Triggers a dramatic "Vine Boom" or "Sad Trombone" based on your score.
* **🎞️ Reactive GIFs:** Visual feedback changes based on your stress level (Vibing Cat -> This is Fine -> Elmo on Fire).
* **✨ "Fix My Life" Button:** A satirical schedule optimizer that cancels your meetings and schedules "Touch Grass" and "Scream into Pillow" sessions instead.
* **📸 Share the Pain:** Generates a downloadable `.png` meme card using `html2canvas` so you can post your failure on LinkedIn.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Neo-Brutalist / Vibe Coding style)
* **AI Backend:** Groq Cloud API (Model: `llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`)
* **Vibes:** `canvas-confetti`, `lucide-react`, `html2canvas`
